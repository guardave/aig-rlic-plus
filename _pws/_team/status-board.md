## 2026-03-14 — Lead Lesandro

**Status:** Completed / Checkpoint

**Accomplished:**
- Executed priority pairs #1 (INDPRO), #2 (SOFR/TED, 3 variants), #3 (Building Permits), with #20 (HY-IG) pre-existing
- 4 of 73 priority pairs now completed
- Full pipeline per pair: data → models → tournament → charts → portal → browser verify → completeness gate → MRA
- Landing page: filterable card grid with hover hints, dropdown sidebar, equal-height cards
- SOPs updated: MRA protocol (Step 9), Deliverables Completeness Gate (Step 8), Browser Verification (Step 7), Viz Preferences, persona rename (Alex → Lesandro)

**Discoveries & Insights:**
- RoC/momentum signals beat level signals (confirmed 3/3 pairs)
- 6-month lead is default for monthly indicators (confirmed 3/3 pairs)
- SOFR ≠ LIBOR (r=-0.04); DFF-DTB3 is the canonical TED proxy (r=+0.63)
- Streamlit `unsafe_allow_html` silently fails on nested HTML — use native components
- Browser verification catches rendering bugs; completeness gate catches missing pages
- ~150K tokens per recurring pair; pipeline 7-14s wall-clock

**Blockers:** None

**Next Steps:**
- Pair #4: US10Y-US3M → SPY (yield curve slope)
- Continue systematic pair execution with MRA
- Consider template-based portal pages at 10+ pairs
