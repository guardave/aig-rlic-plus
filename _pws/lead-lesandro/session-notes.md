- `78f0d54`/`bdc997f` Fix trade log path resolution
- `aab9fd0` Add trade log CSV for dashboard display

### Status
- 5 of 73 pairs completed (#1 INDPRO, #2 TED, #3 Permits, #11 VIX/VIX3M, #20 HY-IG)
- FOMC SEP sub-project: viewer functional, 70 meetings indexed
- Next: Pair #4 US10Y-US3M → SPY

## Session: 2026-04-10

### Context
SOP hardening Part C: full multi-agent re-run of HY-IG v2, then audience-friendliness improvements.

### Commits (4 today)
- `b009674` HY-IG v2: full multi-agent pipeline test of hardened SOPs (40 files, +12,414 lines)
- `17f1690` Fix StreamlitPageNotFoundError on Cloud (try/except fallback)
- `8767a8a` Fix chart rendering: filename mismatch between Vera and Ace
- `61efe7d` SOP: add audience-friendliness rules to Research and AppDev SOPs (+130 lines)
- `d9aeaff` HY-IG v2: rewrite narrative and pages with audience-friendly SOP rules (+548/-266)

### Key Accomplishments
1. Full 5-agent pipeline re-run of HY-IG v2 (Ray → Dana → Evan → Vera → Ace)
   - Winner: HMM stress / T4_0.5 / P2 Signal Strength (Sharpe 1.27 vs ref 1.17)
   - 18-item completeness gate: 17/17 PASS
2. Diagnosed and fixed 2 Cloud deployment issues:
   - st.page_link fails on Cloud (try/except fallback)
   - Chart filenames: Vera used pair_id prefix, Ace didn't (charts.py now tries both)
3. Comparative analysis: v2 pages vs sample pages — identified 5 audience-friendliness gaps
4. Added 7 new SOP rules across Research + AppDev SOPs
5. Re-ran Ray + Ace with new SOPs — pages now have inline definitions, translation bridges, rule-first layout

### Lessons Learned
1. **Agent delegation**: User corrected me twice for doing agent-level work manually. Lead role = coordinate and decide, not implement.
2. **Chart naming convention needs SOP rule**: Vera and Ace used different naming (prefixed vs unprefixed). Fixed in charts.py loader, but should standardize in team-coordination SOP.
3. **Streamlit Cloud differs from local**: page_link path resolution, version differences. Always test on Cloud, not just locally.
4. **Audience-friendliness is a process gap, not a content gap**: The v2 data was good; the prose style was the problem. SOP rules fix this systematically.
5. **Translation bridges are high-ROI**: Adding "What this means:" after findings dramatically improves readability at minimal cost.

### Status
- 6 of 73 pairs: #1 INDPRO, #2 TED (3 variants), #3 Permits, #11 VIX/VIX3M, #20 HY-IG (sample + v2)
- SOPs now include audience-friendliness rules
- Next: Pair #4 US10Y-US3M → SPY
Brief session — context refresh and sync only. No code changes, no new analysis.

## Session: 2026-03-14

### Context
Continued from prior session that completed the multi-indicator enhancement framework and cross-review. This session executed the first 4 priority pairs from the 73-pair catalog.

### Accomplished

**Pair #1: INDPRO → SPY** (commits dd702b6 → ce4da73)
- Full 7-stage pipeline: data → alignment → stationarity → exploratory → 9 models → 1,666-combo tournament → validation
- Surprise: z-score counter-cyclical at extremes (peak-cycle mean-reversion, p=0.007)
- Best OOS Sharpe 1.10 (3M momentum, L6, Long/Cash) vs 0.90 B&H
- 10 Plotly charts, 4 portal pages, landing page redesigned as filterable card grid

**Pair #2: TED Variants → SPY** (commits 6fe3195 → a8ca9f6)
- Splice analysis revealed SOFR ≠ LIBOR (r=-0.04). DFF-DTB3 is canonical TED proxy (r=+0.63)
- Ran 3 variants: SOFR Sharpe 1.89 (inflated, 3yr OOS), DFF 0.97 (robust), Spliced 1.19
- Introduced "variant family" pattern for one-question-multiple-measurements

**Pair #3: Building Permits → SPY** (commits e1c4455 → 01fbb4a)
- Best OOS Sharpe 1.45 (MoM, P25, Long/Short, L6) vs 0.90 B&H
- Pro-cyclical confirmed, first P3 (Long/Short) win
- Pipeline: 7.0s, 856 combos, 675 valid

**Infrastructure & SOP improvements:**
- Landing page: filterable card grid with hover hints on direction badges
- Sidebar: dropdown selector replacing congested flat page list
- Auto-nav hidden via `showSidebarNavigation = false`
- CSS: equal-height cards via flexbox stretch
- Rendering fixes: `render_narrative()` no HTML wrapper; markdown tables for narrow columns
- SOPs updated: MRA protocol (Step 9), Deliverables Completeness Gate (Step 8), Iterative Browser Review (Step 7), Viz Preferences
- Persona renamed Alex → Lesandro

### Key Patterns Confirmed (3/3 pairs)
1. **RoC/momentum signals > level signals** — every pair won with rate-of-change
2. **6-month lead for monthly indicators** — consistent across INDPRO, TED, Permits
3. **Streamlit HTML rendering is unreliable** — always use native components + Playwright verification

### What Worked Well
- Pipeline template reuse (7s for pair #3 vs 13s for pair #1)
- Completeness gate caught the missing TED methodology page pattern
- Variant family approach for SOFR/LIBOR disambiguation
- MRA process improving quality with each iteration

### What Didn't Work Well
- Port proliferation when restarting Streamlit (fixed: always reuse 8501)
- NumPy bool JSON serialization bug (needs `bool()` cast in template)
- First landing page used raw HTML divs (Streamlit silently fails)
- TED methodology page was skipped until user caught it
